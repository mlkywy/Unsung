## Unsung

Spring Capstone 2022. An experimental demo made in Unity, featuring custom characters, dialogue system, turn-based battle system, saving/loading, etc. Use WASD/arrow keys for movement, spacebar to jump, and 'E' to interact with NPCs and the environment.

The game only has one ending and may be played in the browser or downloaded as an executable.
