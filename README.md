## Star-Crossed

In a warship in space, a communications blackout is put in place to prevent the enemy from intercepting and potentially locating the warship. The cadet uses an unmanned drone to send love letters to their love on their home planet.

Game jam [submission](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-11/rate/2281170) for [GBJAM11](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-11), and our first one ever!

Features 5 stages and 23 unique letters, and pending. :)

A major bug includes hearts disappearing at the start of a battle sequence. UI elements also disappear and do not scale properly on full-screen. Gamepad controls have some issues, so mouse/keyboard is recommended.

This game is still in the prototype phase and requires more polish (assets and animations, music and sound effects, letter content, scene transitions, difficulty adjustment, etc.).
